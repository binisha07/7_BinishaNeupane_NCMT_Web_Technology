# Chapter 4: Website Design Principles
## Short Questions:
### 1. Differentiate between legibility and readability.
### => Legibility is the visual clarity of an individual letters and symbols such as fonts, size, contrast, stroke weight etc. On the other hand, readability is the ease of reading and understanding large amounts of text such as line spacing, line length, layout etc.

### 2. What is "Rule of Thirds" in layout design?
### => The rule of thirds in website design layout design is the layout which uses an imaginary 3*3 grid (two horizontal and two vertical lines) to position key elements like text and images at the four intersection points or along the line for a balanced, natural and engaging look.

### 3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?
### => We should limit the number of font families used on a website for better performance, visual sonsistency, readability, improved time loads, and reduced design clutters.

### 4. Define "Responsive Web Design".
### => Responsive web design is an approach building websites that automatically adapt their layout and content to fit the user's screen size and device.

## Group B:Long Questions
### 5. Explain the "F-Pattern" of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a web page.
### => The "F-pattern" describes a common user behavior when scanning web pages with large amounts of text. It is a visual pattern in which the user's eye movement generally resembles the letter "F". This scanning habit influences the optimal placement of critical content on a webpage to ensure maximum visibility and engagement. 
### The F-pattern generally consists of three components:
### a. The horizontal movement across the upper part of the content area. This initial stroke of the F is where users read the most important information first, usually titles, primary navigation, and initial sentences.
### b. The second, shorter horizontal movement slightly further down the page. Users scan across a secondary point of interest or subheading, creating the second, shorter bar of the F.
### c. The vertical scan down the left side of the page. The final movement is a quick vertical scan to find keywords or specific points of interest further down the page.
### Understanding the F-pattern is vital for web design and content strategy. It dictates that users are most likely to see the content positioned in the areas where their eyes naturally track. Top left area receives the most attention. Crucial information, such as the main headline, the site's logo, primary navigation, and the core value proposition, should be placed here. Content placed along the left margin—including subheadings, bullet points, item lists, and calls to action—is more likely to be noticed during the vertical scan . Formatting text into scannable lists or short paragraphs optimizes this vertical visibility.Content in the middle and right-hand side of the page generally receives less attention. Designers often reserve these areas for secondary information, related links, or images that support the main content.
